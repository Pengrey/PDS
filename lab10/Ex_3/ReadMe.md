# H1 The problem
    Imagine we are working in a company. That company only has a meetting room. This company also has accountants and engineers. Usually when someone wants to use the meeeting room, they would ask every other employee if they are using the meeting room. This worked when they were few, but the company has grown and now they are a lot, so this takes some time. How should we implement the Mediator pattern to make this process easier?

# H2 The solution
    By introducing a Boss, the workers only have to ask the Boss if the meeting room is available, meaning that they will not need to interact with everyone else, thus being more independent and making it easier if a different type of worker starts working at the company.
